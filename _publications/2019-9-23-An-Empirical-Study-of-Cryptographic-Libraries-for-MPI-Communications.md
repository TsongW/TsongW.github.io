In this work, we consider incorporating encryption to support privacy and integrity in the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library, which is widely used in HPC applications. We empirically study four contemporary cryptographic libraries, OpenSSL, BoringSSL, Libsodium, and CryptoPP using micro-benchmarks and NAS parallel benchmarks to evaluate their overheads for encrypting MPI messages on two different networking technologies, 10Gbps Ethernet and 40Gbps InfiniBand.
