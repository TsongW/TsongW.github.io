I am a PhD. Candidate in the Department of [Computer Science](https://www.cs.fsu.edu) at Florida State University. I conduct research under the guidance of Dr. [Viet Tung Hoang] (https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~tvhoang)


I am highly interested in Cryptography, Cybersecurity, and Parallel and Distributed Systems, with a particular focus on symmetric-key cryptography, cryptographic scheme analysis, and the design and development of authenticated encryption (AE) schemes. Additionally, I have gained valuable experience working with Cloud, MPICH/MVAPICH, and performance analysis and optimization techniques.
