### Committing Security   
----
* Developing robust and secure committing authenticated-encryption schemes that effectively counter the partition oracle attack. This attack poses a significant threat to widely adopted AEAD schemes such as AES-GCM, XSalsa20/Poly1305, and ChaCha20/Poly1305. Our goal is to set a new standard for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol in https.



### QuickLog   
----
* Developed an fast and secure logging system at the Linux kernel level, surpassing
the state-of-the-art in adoptability, performance, and security. **USENIX Badges
Award**:[Artifacts Available, Artifacts Functional, and Results Reproduced]


### CryptMPI 
----
* Developed encrypted communication library for Cloud-based Parallel and Distributed
computing architecture. Implemented C-based solution utilizing novel collective
algorithms, pre-computation, multithreading, and pipelining techniques on
top of MVAPICH and MPICH to accelerate encrypted communication.

### EncryptedMPI
----
* Evaluated authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) performance with MPI communication using modern cryptographic libraries such as OpenSSL/BoringSSL, libsodium, and Crypto++.
